ECAD and documentation repository for everything electronics related to Rotational &amp; Controlled Mechanism and transmission system for camera scanner project.

# Abstract
Among the services offered by Multitaskr, a 3D manual scanning of rooms with a camera is performed. With the purpose of improving processes, the automation of this process is proposed by developing a mobile and foldable platform that allows modifying the Pitch and Yaw position (in a range of 360 and -45 to 45, respectively) of the camera via a robotic system with 2 degrees of freedom.

The development considers the use of SCRUM methodology to keep track of the proposed objectives and detected failures; CAD and ECAD software (SolidWorks and Eagle); MATLAB for the design and tuning of the controller; TEC laboratories and other related facilities; as well as testing the system to identify areas of opportunity.

In order to achieve this goal, the process will last 10 weeks and will be divided into areas (Mechanics, Electronics, Control and Manufacturing) with the involvement of 8th semester students in Mechatronics with relevant experience in these areas. The testing phase is intended to ensure the delivery of a product according to the specifications.  

A functional prototype is expected to be delivered with the requirements established in the design process; as well as an "Engineering Manual" with CAD models, research processes, schematics, codes and operation guidelines along with the tests and areas of opportunity identified. 

It has been identified that the system can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the process, benefiting Multitaskr operationally and providing its clients with greater value in the services acquired.

# Objective of this repository
To track and mantain in a single platform all related documents in order to be able to replicate the project if needed. Expect to find:
* Entries to the Engineering Manual on the electronics subdivision and updates to said entries.
* ECAD files of the desgined circuits
* Diagrams/Drawings
